        <h4>They alone live, who live for others......... Swami Vivekananda</h4>

        <p>
            The objective/goal(s) of this organization is to focus on the following sections in our village.They are some of the sections which are very much necessary to any society. Each one is unique in its own style but they are interrelated. In all of the below sections we will give priority to girls and women because they are ignored and not cared much when compared to boys and men in our society.
        </p><br>
        <dl>
            <h4>1. Education</h4>
            <dt>Why we want to focus on this:</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    This Organization strongly feels that Education is essential to every human being. Education is not a privilege but it is every person's right. Everyone deserves to be educated no matter what the financial condition of the student. There is a saying: "Children of this generation are the citizens of the next generation". So, if we can guide and help children/students in the right direction then the future of some families might be good and hence the future of our village will be good. The above said are the reasons why we want to give Education the top most priority of this organization.Also, our goal is to achieve 100% literacy rate in our village.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, in addition to the mere education we want to focus on the character building education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand on one's own feet" - Swami Vivekananda

        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>What we want to do:</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>We have two kinds of goals in this category:</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>i. Short term goals</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
                a) Career guidance to high school and college students. Conduct career guidance classes to students once a year to high school and intermediate students. This is mainly to help the students to choose the right career. Also, help the degree students whenever necessary and help them in getting the job. We will stress the importance of communication (English) in this.
            </p>

            <p>
                b) Sports and Personality development competitions.
    Planning to conduct sports meet once a year in the schools and distribute prizes and certificates. This is to encourage the students to be physically fit (For a student to have good study he/she has to be physically fit before mentally fit). Sports help the students to learn how to co-ordinate in a group and also improve their leadership qualities.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, in addition to the sports meet we will conduct some personality development competitions. Such as Elocution, Debate, Essay writing, etc. These competitions will encourage the students to improve their communication skills and also gain some knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                c) Supply equipment/funds to the schools
    We will supply the equipments which are required and help the students to improve understand their studies. We will also provide some funds for the needs of the schools, for eg: to provide drinking water and for sanitation.
            </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>ii. Long term goals</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
                a) Financially help a student
    We will find out bright and poor students and help & guide them to continue their study till they get a job. In this case probably we may have to take care of the student from 9th or 10th class and it will take at least 8 years for that student to settle in life. Once that guy settles, he/she can take care of his/her family and might help some others in the situation where he/she was few years ago.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>2. Healthcare</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Why we want to focus on this:</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
                "Health is Wealth". This is another very important area on which we want to focus. At the same time, it is little bit complicated and difficult to do. Health plays a major role in the society. If the people in a society are healthy then we can say that the society is happy and prosperous. Also, that society will definitely have an edge, in all the fields, over the other societies which are not so healthy.
            </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
          <h4>What we want to do:</h4>
      <ul>
        <dt>i. Health Awareness</dt>
        <li>Child level</li>
        <li>Adult level</li>
      </ul>

      <dl>
        <dt>ii. Blood Donation Camps</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    We slowly plan to conduct blood donation camps after start creating health awareness (Definitely it will take some time if not too much time). It is a good habit to donate blood once in a while. It not only keeps the person (who donates the blood) active and it also helps to save the life of another person, one of the greatest things we ever do in our life.
                </p>   
            </dd>
      </dl>

       <dl>
        <dt>iii. Health Camps and Awareness</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    This will also take some time to start, probably one or two years. The thing is we need people in addition to money to conduct the camps. So, we will plan to conduct Health/Dental camps whenever possible. "Prevention is better than cure". So, after conducting the health camps we will conduct health awareness meetings by the Doctor to educate the people. Most people will listen to the Doctor because they have faith in him/her that he/she can cure.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    One of the Major issues which we are thinking with Healthcare is that there might be some legal problems if something goes wrong and the other one is to get permission from the officials to conduct the camps.

                </p>

            <dt>ii. Religious Activities</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    First we are planning to clean up/make adjustments to the floor in the "Sri Ram" temple. Afterwards based on the needs of the temples we will take up one by one.
                </p>

        <dt>i. Clean and green of our village</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    It is always good to be neat. So we will do clean and green programs once in a while and educate the villagers about the same.<br>
                    a)	Taking care of “Koneru”
                </p>   
            </dd>

            <dt>ii. Other needs of our village</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    We will also work on the other social needs of our village based on the priority, availability of funds, people, etc
                </p>   
            </dd>
      </dl>
      <h4>5. Recognizing/Awarding the servants of our society:</h4>
      <h4>Why we want to focus on this:</h4>
      <dl>
        <dt>i. Clean and green of our village</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>
                    One reason why we need to award people is to simply tell them that they have done a wonderful job. The people who receive award will feel a kind of satisfaction and keep focus on what they are doing and if possible they will try to put even more efforts. Awarding is also to project the good in the society, in other words encourage others to follow them.
                </p>   
            </dd>
        </dl> 
        <h4>What we want to do:></h4>
        <dl>
        <dt>i. Recognize the prominent people of our village</dt>
         <dd>
            <p>
            a) Planning to reward who served our village. First of all, we are planning to reward who served/serving our country directly.
    b) We are planning to award people who are successful in their own field and thereby made our village proud.<br><br>

    In a sentence, our goal is to take part and if possible play a key role in all the good activities that will take place in our village. Come let's start a new beginning, a beginning which will change the course of our village and will keep our village as a model village to the neighboring villages.<br><br>
